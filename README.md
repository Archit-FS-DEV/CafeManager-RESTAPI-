# CafeManager-RESTAPI-

This project is a RESTful API for managing cafe data, built using Flask and SQLAlchemy. The API allows users to perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on a SQLite database of cafes. Key features include:

Fetching random or all cafes.
Searching cafes by location.
Adding new cafes.
Updating cafe details, like coffee prices.
Deleting cafes with authentication via an API key.
This project demonstrates the use of Flask for building APIs, SQLAlchemy for database interactions, and RESTful principles for structuring endpoints.
